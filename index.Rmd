### The Musically shapeshifting genius that is Miles Davis 
![Self-portrait by Miles Davis](milespainting5.jpg)



***

For my corpus I have decided to investigate the jazz trumpet player Miles Davis. Davis is known within the jazz and global community as a constant innovator and key figure of jazz music. His method for innovation was to constantly attract upcoming talents and stars within the upcoming current in jazz. He then instructed these youngsters with his own vision of jazz and this was reciprocated by the youngsters how provided him with their own new views. 

In my corpus I will try to analyse Davis’ music by answering some of the following questions:

-	How did Davis’ music change over time, what are the constants in his music and what are the variables?

-	How did Davis’ music reflect other albums of each specific time period that he was adapting to?


The following phases of Miles Davis’ oeuvre could be examined

-	Early bebop/Charlie Parker phase: 1945-1950

-	Hard Bop phase: 1950-1955

-	Miles Davis Cool Phase: 1955-1963

-	Miles Davis Acoustic Erratic: 1963-1968

-	Miles Davis electric/funk fusion: 1968-1975

-	Miles Davis Hiatus: 1975-1980

- Miles Davis final years: 1980-1992

***
When starting out his career, Miles started playing with the bebop-greats like Charlie Parker and Dizzie Gillespie, bebop is a jazz-genre that was (kind of) mainstream during the 1940ies and was characterized by high tempo's and a great focus on technical skill rather than expression. Miles never was a great technical player (compared to the big figures of the time) and was keen on going towards slower paced music in which he could show his sense of expression. As such he was one of the pivotal figures in the "Cool Jazz" movement that emerged in the early 50ies and resulted in slower paced music. This is the point in which the energy seemed to drop along with the valence. <br>

At the turn of the 60ies Miles wanted to get rid of conventional music harmonic theory and looked to experiment with more difficult time-signatures, free-jazz (in which the form was completely lost) and electrical instruments. This is best characterized by the decrease in acousticness. Another trend seen in the chart is the increase in liveness of his oeuvre which is best explained by the fact that he wanted to create music on the spot as much as possible, with long improvised songs that did not follow any predetermined structure. 

<i> This was just an introduction, the text is not definite and I will have to look up more stuff </i>



### Miles in terms of Valence, Danceability and energy
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# miles_plot <- ggplot(miles_decades, aes(x = danceability, y = energy, col = Time_Period)) + 
#   geom_jitter()
ggplot(miles_long, aes(x = danceability, y = energy, col = valence)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ Time_Period)

```

Interpretation will follow soon


### Conclusion week 8
So far I've worked on some extra plots and incorporating everything into a storyboard. I still have a lot to do though....
